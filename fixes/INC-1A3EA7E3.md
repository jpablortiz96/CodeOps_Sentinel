# Incident Fix: INC-1A3EA7E3

## Diagnosis
- **Root Cause**: N+1 ORM query pattern in the payment handler: each order triggers a separate DB call to fetch line items. With 847 queries/request at peak load, this saturates CPU and exhausts the connection pool.
- **Severity**: IncidentSeverity.CRITICAL
- **Affected Services**: payment-service, postgresql, api-gateway
- **Detected At**: 2026-02-21 02:10:36 UTC

## Recommended Fix
Add composite index to eliminate full table scan on transactions

## Code Changes
```python
# Original code (problematic)
-- No index on transactions(user_id, created_at)
-- Current: Seq Scan cost=234891.23

# Fixed code
-- Fix: CONCURRENTLY avoids table lock in production
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS
  idx_transactions_user_date
ON transactions(user_id, created_at DESC)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;  -- partial index for active records only

ANALYZE transactions;
-- Expected: Seq Scan -> Index Scan, cost 234891 -> 0.42 (99.9% reduction)
```
