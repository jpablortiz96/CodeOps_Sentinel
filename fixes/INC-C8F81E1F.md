# Incident Fix: INC-C8F81E1F

## Diagnosis
- **Root Cause**: EventEmitter memory leak in WebSocket session handler. Listeners accumulate without removal on client disconnect, causing unbounded heap growth. At 91.5% memory, OOMKill is imminent in ~10 minutes.
- **Severity**: IncidentSeverity.HIGH
- **Affected Services**: auth-service, session-store
- **Detected At**: 2026-02-20 17:05:36 UTC

## Recommended Fix
Add composite index to eliminate full table scan on transactions

## Code Changes
```python
# Original code (problematic)
-- No index on transactions(user_id, created_at)
-- Current: Seq Scan cost=234891.23

# Fixed code
-- Fix: CONCURRENTLY avoids table lock in production
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS
  idx_transactions_user_date
ON transactions(user_id, created_at DESC)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;  -- partial index for active records only

ANALYZE transactions;
-- Expected: Seq Scan -> Index Scan, cost 234891 -> 0.42 (99.9% reduction)
```
