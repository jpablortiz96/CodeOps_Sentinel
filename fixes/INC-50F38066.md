# Incident Fix: INC-50F38066

## Diagnosis
- **Root Cause**: Missing composite index on transactions(user_id, created_at). PostgreSQL planner performs full sequential scan on 12.4M rows for every user history query. Traffic spike 3× normal multiplied the impact.
- **Severity**: IncidentSeverity.HIGH
- **Affected Services**: postgresql, user-service, api-gateway
- **Detected At**: 2026-02-20 15:00:06 UTC

## Recommended Fix
Increase memory limit to 1Gi and add HPA for memory-based autoscaling

## Code Changes
```python
# Original code (problematic)
resources:
  limits:
    memory: '512Mi'
    cpu: '500m'

# Fixed code
resources:
  requests:
    memory: '512Mi'  # Fix: raised to match observed baseline
    cpu: '250m'
  limits:
    memory: '1Gi'    # Fix: 2x headroom above P99 peak
    cpu: '1000m'     # Fix: allow CPU burst on traffic spikes
# HPA added separately in hpa.yaml
# minReplicas: 3, maxReplicas: 10, memory trigger: 75%
```

## Auto-Remediation Applied
- **Action**: Stopped chaos experiment via API
- **Result**: Service recovered
- **Resolution Time**: N/A
